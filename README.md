# ColorBalls

This is my first try in Unity ever and I was quite surprised that I could make this game without any prior Unity experience just in 1 week!
 
Map, balls, and levels are randomly generated each time. Your goal is to archive target color by mixing right balls. If you want to reset your color â€“ just hit a white ball.
